Mission Accomplished is a simple side-scrolling shoot-'em-up implemented
as a personal challenge to develop a video game from an original idea.

The goal of the game is to defeat all the enemies on the level before
your health bar turns completely red. The health bar for your character,
as well as the enemies, appear above the respective character's sprite.
Shoot projectiles at the enemies to injure them, and respectively avoid
projectiles from the enemies to avoid damage.
